# Contributing

1. Pick an item from `PROJECT_INDEX.md` and announce the ID in your PR description.
2. Follow `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` for commenting and naming.
3. Each project must ship with: `README.md`, `Makefile`, at least one example, and a test binary runnable via `make test`.
4. Keep implementations self-contained inside their project directory; shared utilities belong in `common/`.
5. Favor clarity over micro-optimizations unless performance is the explicit research goal of the project.
